Issues I've yet to fix:
1) Currently displayed profile in "/" should not be replaced by a new one after settings are changed if gender criteria are met
2) Some of the CSS still feels hacky.
3) Some components should be refactored into functional, stateless ones
4) Dummy/placeholder image should be displayed during loading actual image, avoiding jumpy page loads
5) Transitions could be a lot smoother
6) Should `git --gud` at design
