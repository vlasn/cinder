Issues I've yet to fix:
1) currently displayed profile in / should not be replaced by a new one after settings are changed if gender criteria are met
2) Some of the CSS still feels hacky.
3) Dummy/placeholder image should be displayed during loading actual image, avoiding jumpy page loads
4) Transitions could be a lot smoother
5) Should `git --gud` at design.
